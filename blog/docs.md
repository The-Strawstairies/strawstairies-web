Welcome to our shiny new website for our final Principles Of Engineering project! We'll be updating and posting new content to this page throughout the next eight week of project design and development.

We've decided to use [Notion.so](http://notion.so) for documentation, task management, scrum boards, budgeting, and more. We'll also be using Github for source control and Grabcad for CAD model management.
