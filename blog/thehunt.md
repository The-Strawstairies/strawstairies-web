When we sourced parts a few weeks ago (what feels like a few months ago), there were a few components we left off the order sheet to conserve budget with the mindset of "we're at a private engineering school, how hard could it be to find?" Turns out there are a bunch of parts that you would think are accessible, but end up being very specific and difficult to make work. For instance, We purchased #25 chain with the assumption that we could find a #25 chain breaker somewhere on campus. We've found many chain breakers (#20, #35, and even #40); We have not found any #25 chain breakers. We knew this was a possibility so we didn't design with a specific chain breaker being the only way to break it. Ideally we will use a pin and an arbor press to punch out a hole and use masterlinks to reconnect the chain. Even with this problem solved, 12 gauge wire might be difficult to find and adds time to what we have to do and worry about. Additionally, we purchased a Lipo battery with a connector that we have seen before. However, when we went to use the battery chargers that were available to us, we realized quickly that we needed some sort of adapter for the plug into the battery. This issue came out of nowhere just because we assumed that little logistic details would all fall into place. 

Kaizen: Don't assume the best :(
